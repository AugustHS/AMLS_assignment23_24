#copy the code from folder 'A' and 'B' according to the instructions in README to run implementation here
#file 'code for task A' contains the final code for task A
#file 'code for task B' contains the final code for task B
#important: if you copy the code from 'A' and 'B' folders to here, please remember to change the '../' in 'data = np.load('../Datasets/<file name>')' into './' or just remove'../',beacuse the relative path of dataset has changed.
